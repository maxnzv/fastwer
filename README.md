# FastWER-Go: High-Performance Word Error Rate Calculation in Go
FastWER-Go is a Go-based library for calculating Word Error Rate (WER) efficiently and accurately. Designed to process large datasets quickly, it provides a reliable metric for evaluating the performance of speech recognition and machine translation systems. The library is inspired by the original FastWER library, but rewritten in Go for improved speed and integration with Go projects.

Based on code from https://github.com/kahne/fastwer

## Features
- High-performance WER calculation
- Minimal dependencies for easy integration
- Simple API for quick adoption
- Accurate handling of large datasets
- Fully compatible with Go modules
